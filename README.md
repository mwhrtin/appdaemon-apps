# appdaemon-apps
This is my personal collection of Appdaemon apps that I've used in my HomeAssistant setup. 

Some are still being used, some have been replaced but are kept for reference. 

The apps were written for my personal needs and my specific use cases, but feel free to use them if they fit your needs. 

## Apps

- [group_notifier](https://github.com/mwhrtin/appdaemon-apps/tree/main/group_notifier) - Send notifications to groups of recipients with zone support.
- [switch_control](https://github.com/mwhrtin/appdaemon-apps/tree/main/switch_control) - Map Zigbee switches and remote controls to entities.
